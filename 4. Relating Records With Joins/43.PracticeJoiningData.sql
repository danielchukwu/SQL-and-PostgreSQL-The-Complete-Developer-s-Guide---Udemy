-- Program: You are designing a database for a book publishing company. The database needs to store a table of authors and books. An author has many books. This means that books should have a foreign key column/property that references another

--        authors                         books
-- id      name                |   id     title                  author_id
-- 1     JK Rowling            |   1      It                         2
-- 2    Stephen King           |   2      Chamber of Secrets         1
-- 3    Agatha Christie        |   3      Cat and the Hat            4
-- 4     Dr Suess              |   4      Affair at Styles           3

-- 1. Implement both tables and insert their individual records
-- 2. Write a query that will join together these two tables. For each book, print the title of the book and the name of the author
